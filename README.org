Computer language toolkit for Go


This repository contains a subset of Go modules I wrote for my master's dissertation
/ final year project - titled "Computer Language Design and Engineering" -  at
Royal Holloway, University of London.

I intend to release all cltk code as well as my technical writing in the form of
blog posts @ https://wsantos.io. For now I am holding off until I have 1) finished
basic documentation and 2) have made things more presentable for public display.
